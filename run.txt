  --start-jumps STARTJUMPS, -s STARTJUMPS
                        Consider stations within this many jumps of the origin
                        (requires --from).
  --end-jumps ENDJUMPS, -e ENDJUMPS
                        Consider stations within this many jumps of the
                        destination (requires --to).
  --show-jumps, -J      Show detail of jumps between hops.
  --limit N             Maximum units of any one cargo item to buy (0:
                        unlimited).
  --age DAYS, --max-days-old DAYS, -MD DAYS
                        Maximum age (in days) of trade data to use.
  --pad-size PADSIZES, -p PADSIZES
                        Limit to stations with one of the specified pad sizes,
                        e.g. --pad SML? matches any pad, --pad M matches only
                        medium pads.
  --no-planet           Require stations to be in space.
  --planetary PLANETARY
                        Limit to stations with one of the specified planetary,
                        e.g. --pla YN? matches any station, --pla Y matches
                        only planetary stations.
  --fleet-carrier FLEET, --fc FLEET
                        Limit to stations with one of the specified fleet-
                        carrier, e.g. --fc YN? matches any station, --fc Y
                        matches only fleet-carrier stations.
  --black-market, --bm  Require stations known to have a black market.
  --ls-penalty LSPENALTY, --lsp LSPENALTY
                        Penalty per 1kls stations are from their stars.
  --ls-max LS           Only consider stations upto this many ls from their
                        star.
  --gain-per-ton MINGAINPERTON, --gpt MINGAINPERTON
                        Specify the minimum gain per ton of cargo
  --max-gain-per-ton MAXGAINPERTON, --mgpt MAXGAINPERTON
                        Specify the maximum gain per ton of cargo

                        at least this percentage of the current best routes
                        score.

  --progress, -P        Show hop progress
  --supply SUPPLY       Only considers items which have at least this many
                        units.
  --demand DEMAND       Only considers items which have at least this much

  --summary             Summary layout of route instructions.
  --shorten             (Requires --to) Find the shortest route with the best
                        gpt.
